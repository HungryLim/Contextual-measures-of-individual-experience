# Contextual-measures-of-individual-experience

Various studies on contextual effects have found different findings based on different theories with different measures. Some studies find that people's environment affect their public opinion and behaviors (Hopkins 2010; key 1949; Huckfeldt 1986; Cho and Baer 2011). Other studies argue that contextual influence is minimal (King 1996; Gallego et al. 2016). However, one problem in existing contextual literature is in the lack of consistency in the unit of analysis (Cho and Baer 2011). Some scholars used traditional county or Census track level contextual data and others used more fine-grained or new measure of context. Therefore, it is not surprising that the findings of different studies vary with the different measures of context. 

Then, to examine contextual effect, what measurement should we use? We need to start to find the answer of this question with theories of contextual effect. In other words, we need to consider the mechanism of contextual effect. Some scholars argues that the influx other races or outgroup increases racial threat and it affects people's negative attitudes (Giles and Buckner 1993; Key 1949). On the contrary, other scholars state that inter group interaction reduce stereotype and negative attitude towards outgroup (Oliver and Wong 2003; Welch et al. 2001; Cho and Baer 2011). These two different theories share a crucial point in that contact with other race or outgroup is the key to the mechanism. Therefore, when we consider the context and contact, we should consider how our daily lives and actual experience in micro level environment can be captured by our measurement. Then, with the individualized fine-grained contextual data, we can explore the contextual effect more accurately and more realistically. 

Therefore, in this paper, we used Milieu data which is based on people's actual GPS tracking record and Census block data to test the effect of context on racial resentment. We find that our measure of geographic context does not hold conventional level of statistical significance on racial resentment. We also test the same model with different measures of context (State, county and Census track), but the contextual effect is statistically unreliable. 

However, an interesting finding with the dynamic Milieu measure is that there is systematic mismeasurement of context among non-white respondents. The contextual measure of non-white are systematically distant from the contextual measure of white in terms of racial composition of Census block. It implies that the findings of contextual effect could not be well applied to racial minorities and the systematic mismeasurement could result bias in findings.
